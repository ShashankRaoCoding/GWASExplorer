  <h1> How to use GWAS Explorer </h1>
  <br> 
  <img src="Website-Resources/sample.png" > 
  <br> 
  <p>GWAS Explorer is meant for in-browser visualisation of data, primarily
    summary statistics (although other data will also likely work).
    To use, simply:
    <ol>
      <li>Select the files you would like to visualise</li>
      <li>Select the parameters to plot</li>
      <li>Select the id (this is to help you identify your data points)</li>
    </ol>

    Hover the cursor over the data points to see more info.

    None of the data is sent to our servers.

    <h4> Acceptable Data Format </h4> 
    Any TSV file will do, as long as the first row has headers, and data is placed in rows. An example file is linked here: <a style="color: white;" href="Website-Resources/sampleData.tsv">Sample File sourced from FinnGen r12</a>

    Coming soon:
    + Click on the data points to see in depth SNP analysis (if rsids present) from automated GNOMAD database querying.
