  <br> 
  <p>GWAS Explorer is meant for in-browser visualisation of data, primarily
    summary statistics (although other data will also likely work).
    To use, simply:
    <ol>
      <li>Select the files you would like to visualise</li>
      <li>Select the parameters to plot</li>
      <li>Select the id (this is to help you identify your data points)</li>
    </ol>

    Hover the cursor over the data points to see more info.

    None of the data is sent to our servers.

    Coming soon:
    + Click on the data points to see in depth SNP analysis (if rsids present) from automated GNOMAD database querying.
